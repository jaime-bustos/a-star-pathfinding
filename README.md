# a-star-pathfinding-visualization

## Description

This project looks at the A* search algorithm in combination with PyGame for visualization. It uses nodes (blocks) that are filled with color to graphically represent positions on a grid. There is a starting and an end point the user is able to place on the graph. Once the points are placed, the user may use the cursor to draw barriers.
